			    <p>This visualization is very clear and concise in describing the relationships between all those  involved in
			    	the Syrian war. The use of colors also makes it easier to differentiate the relationships</p>
			    <li><a href="http://hint.fm/wind/"> U.S. Wind Map</a></li>
			    <p>It is a good visualization to detect how the wind moves in the US, however, it is a bit difficult to know what
			    	speed it moves since they are described with different shades of black and white. The use of other colors would be beneficial.</p>

	  			1. I would like to visualize the trends on music industry based on "Google Trends" results and see how over time people around the world have shifted their taste in music. This data can be easily retrieved from <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">here.</a><br>
				2. This would tell us how peoples taste overall has shifted from one genre to another that is becoming more popular and possibly see an increase in a specific genre and predict what would be the next popular genre in near future. <br>
				3. People who are interested in music and history of it to see the changes over time with concrete data.<br>
				4. See a small example below. Larger version <a href="ed_viz_lg.png">here.</a><br>
