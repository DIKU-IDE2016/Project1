			    <p>This visualization is very clear and concise in describing the relationships between all those  involved in
			    	the Syrian war. The use of colors also makes it easier to differentiate the relationships. Besides, being an interactive visualization it allows the viewer to get more information than what they can see at the first sight, by simply clicking on the faces. All in all, this simple and digestable visualisation provides a very comprehensive overview about the a complex issue like this which invloves expressing the relationships between multiple groups.</p>
			    <li><a href="http://hint.fm/wind/" target="_blank"> U.S. Wind Map</a></li>
			    <p>It is a good visualization to detect how the wind moves in the US. This simple and intuitive visualization makes it immediately clear for any kind of viewer what the general trends are without any need for numbers. Being an interactive visualisation, it also enables viewers to get more detailed information about the subject by simply clicking on different points on the map. A negative point about this visualization would be poor choice of colors describe the wind drection. Perhaps use of more contrasting colors could make the map easier to read and understand.</p>

	  			1. I would like to visualize the trends on music industry based on "Google Trends" results and see how over time people around the world have shifted their taste in music. This data can be easily retrieved from <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
				2. This would tell us how peoples taste overall has shifted from one genre to another that is becoming more popular and possibly see an increase in a specific genre and predict what would be the next popular genre in near future. <br>
				3. People who are interested in music and history of it to see the changes over time with concrete data.<br>
				4. See a small example below (Click on the image to view it in full size).

	  		<p>
	  			1. One of the things I would like to be able to visualize, is incidences of cancer segmented by different factors such as age, race, gender, year etc. There are mutiple reliable data sources that could be used for this visualization, and one of them is <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov" target="_blank">SEER program</a> of US National Cancer Institute.<br>
				2. The combination of text and visualization would allow doctors and experts to see and compare relevant information about cancer incidence categorized by various factors. This could be beneficial in cancer related studies and experiments.<br>
				3. The target audience for this visualization would be oncologists, scientists or any other group of people who might have an interest in statistics about cancer.<br>
				4. Figure below shows a mock-up of the visualization I would like to learn to build (Click on the image to view it in full size).

	  		<h3>Olugbenga Oti</h3>
	  		<p>
	  			1. An idea I have is to study the weekly activities of computer science students through visualization. This would be activities besides school work, programming or gaming. I would have to acquire the data by myself. If I go through with the idea, the data would be from DIKU students.<br>
	  			2. The combination of the text and visulaization will tell interested parties that computer scientists are not as geeky as they might assume or otherwise.<br>
	  			3. The target audience maybe computer scientists themselves or people interested in knowing about computer scientists.<br>
	  			4. I have included a histogram of some dummy data which includes an activity and the number of people that undertake such activity.(Click on the image to view it in full size).
